# KPMG DATA ANALYSIS VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP

I recently participated in KPMG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on the Data, Analytics & Modelling team at KPMG.
I worked on a project to advise a client on customer targeting and I practiced assessing data quality, generating insights, and creating dashboards in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working to leverage data to produce better business outcomes and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data, Analytics & Modelling.

### TASKS

1.Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

2.For context, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour.Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take.

Please ensure your PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

3.Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance). Maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is welcome. As this is not a KPMG branded deliverable, please find attached a client logo for incorporation. It is important to keep in mind the business context when presenting your findings: What are the trends in the underlying data? Which customer segment has the highest customer value? What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy? What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products? Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.
